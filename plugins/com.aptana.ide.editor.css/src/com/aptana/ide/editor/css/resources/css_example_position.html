<h2>Position Declaration Example</h2>

<div id="header"></div>

<div class="floater">
<p><code>position: fixed</code> is not supported by Explorer 6 and lower on Windows; nor by Explorer 7
in Quirks Mode. In Strict Mode Explorer 7 supports it fine, though.</p>
</div>

<p class="intro">The position declaration lets you declare what the position of an element should be.</p>


<h3>Test</h3>

<p>Test <code>position</code> by changing its value for the test element.</p>

<form name="testForm" action="#">
	<select id="testSelect">
		<option value="static">static</option>
		<option value="relative">relative</option>
		<option value="absolute">absolute</option>
		<option value="fixed">fixed</option>
	</select>
</form>


<div id="testElement">
This is the test element. It has the following styles:
<pre>
top: 100px;
left: 100px;
padding: 1em;
border: 1px solid #cc0000;
</pre>
<div>This element is an absolutely positioned child of the test element.</div>
</div>

<h3>The four values</h3>

<p><code>position</code> takes four values: <code>static</code>, <code>relative</code>, <code>absolute</code>,
and <code>fixed</code>. <code>static</code> is the default value; for any other value you have to apply a
CSS declaration.</p>

<h4>The containing block</h4>

<p>In order to specify the exact position of the element, you have to add <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>,
<code>left</code>, and/or <code>right</code> declarations. These all give coordinates relative to the top/left
or bottom/right reference point. What is this reference point?</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>position: static</code>: No reference point, since a static block cannot be moved.</li>
	<li><code>position: relative</code>: The position the block would take if it were not moved (i.e. if it
	had <code>position: static</code>).</li>
	<li><code>position: absolute</code>: The containing block, which is the first ancestor element
	that does <strong>not</strong> have <code>position: static</code>. If there is no such ancestor,
	the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element serves as the containing block. <span class="smaller">(Note: in older
	browsers the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element serves as the default containing block.)</span></li>
	<li><code>position: fixed</code>: The viewport (browser window).</li>
</ul>

<h4>static</h4>

<p>An element with <code>position: static</code> always has the position the normal flow of the page gives it. It
cannot be moved from this position; a static element ignores any <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>,
<code>left</code>, or <code>right</code> declarations.</p>

<h4>relative</h4>

<p>An element with <code>position: relative</code> initially has the position the normal flow of the page gives
it, but it is subsequently offset by the amount the <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>,
<code>left</code>, and/or <code>right</code> declarations give. Therefore, in combination with such a declaration
it appears slightly skewed. The space the element originally took remains empty.</p>

<p>By themselves, relatively positioned elements are uninteresting, since you almost never want to skew an
element by a few pixels. However, a relatively positioned element serves as a containing block; and this is the
usual reason to use <code>position: relative</code>.</p>

<h4>absolute</h4>

<p>An element with <code>position: absolute</code> is taken out of the normal flow of the page and positioned
at the desired coordinates relative to its containing block.</p>

<p>Since the absolutely positioned element is taken out of the normal flow, the normal document flow behaves as
if the element is not there: it closes up the space it would take.</p>

<h4>fixed</h4>

<p>An element with <code>position: fixed</code> is taken out of the normal flow of the page and positioned at
the desired coordinates relative to the browser window. It remains at that position regardless of scrolling.</p>
