		<description>Here you can specify text to search for and optionally text with which to replace it.

<b>You can specify:</b>
The direction (forward or back from the current cursor
location)The scope (All for the whole file or Selected Lines
to search only within the highlighted area).Multiline option
allows you to switch to multi line mode in which find and replace
input fields allows entering multiple lines as the input.The Whether the
search is Case Sensitive or Whole Word. You can also specify
whether the search wraps at the end of the file. Regular
expressions options allows you to search and replace using
regular expressions. In this case regexp content assist may
help you with content of the strings. Allow escape sequences
option controls how escape sequences whould be transcripted by
the search(when escape sequences are allowed they are interpreted 
as a corresponding symbols in other case they are left as is in the patterns).

If you close the Find/Replace dialog with text in the Find
field, you can use Ctrl+K (or Edit > Find Next) or
Ctrl+Shift+K (or Edit > Find Previous) to go to the next
occurrence of that text. The directions for "Next" and
"Previous" are not affected by the Direction setting in the
Find/Replace dialog.

<b>Incremental Find:</b>
You can also choose Incremental Find from the Find/Replace
dialog. With this option selected, each letter you type in
the Find field causes the editor focus to move to the first
complete occurrence of the text you are typing. You can also
use incremental find by pressing Ctrl+J (Edit > Incremental
Find). In this case, the text you type appears in the Status
Line at the bottom of the Eclipse window. Note: The settings
in the Find/Replace dialog do not affect the operation of
incremental find in the Status Line.
