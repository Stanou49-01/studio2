</p>
<a name="Known_Issues_4"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Known Issues</span></h3>
<p><b>Internal error occurs during "Step Over"</b>
</p><p>While stepping quickly through and over functions via the debugger, you may occasionally get an error message that says that an internal error occurred during "Step Over". This is a known issue and should be fixed in a future release.
</p><p><b>Firefox hangs during fast stepping</b>
</p><p>If you step quickly through the functions in your code (e.g. holding down the F6 key), Firefox may appear to "hang" while it catches up to the debugger. If this happens, you can wait a few seconds, and you should be able to start stepping again. This is a known issue and should be fixed in a future release.

<a name="Aptana_Milestone_4_update_.2808-Aug-2006.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aptana Milestone 4 update (08-Aug-2006)</span></h2>
<p>The Aptana Milestone 4 release (08-Aug-2006) improves on the Aptana Beta .31 Release with several new features and many miscellaneous bug fixes. 
</p>
<a name="What.27s_New_7"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What's New</span></h3>
<p><b>Aptana Snippets</b>
</p><p>With the Aptana Snippets feature, you can now quickly add reusable code templates to your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML files. These Snippets function similarly to macros and help automate common code editing tasks. Default Snippets supplied by Aptana include scripts to specify an HTML DOCTYPE, wrap selected text with a set of HTML tags (e.g. &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, etc.), and inserting a link to a style sheet. See <a href="About_Aptana_Snippets.html" title="About Aptana Snippets">About Aptana Snippets</a> to learn more about Snippets.
</p><p><b>DOCTYPE recognition and XHTML support</b>
</p><p>The Aptana HTML Editor now recognizes different DOCTYPE definitions and displays the appropriate warning/error messages for XHTML. To change the DOCTYPE in your HTML file, delete the default DOCTYPE included in the HTML template and insert one of the DOCTYPE definitions included in the Aptana Snippets in the Actions View. See <a href="About_Aptana_Snippets.html" title="About Aptana Snippets">About Aptana Snippets</a> to learn more about Snippets.
</p><p><b>Error display toggling</b>
</p><p>Aptana now has a Toggle Show Errors button <a href="Image:IconToggleShowErrors.png.html" class="image" title="Image:iconToggleShowErrors.png"><img alt="Image:iconToggleShowErrors.png" src="docs/images/a/a0/IconToggleShowErrors.png" width="23" height="22" border="0" /></a> that allows you to display or hide error messages while you are coding.
</p><p><b>Miscellaneous Bug Fixes</b>
</p><p>This release contains fixes for the following bugs submitted by developers via <a href="http://www.aptana.com/trac" class="external text" title="http://www.aptana.com/trac" rel="nofollow">Trac</a>:
</p>
<ul><li> Over-agressive auto-insertion/matching of elements in the HTML Editor
</li><li> Added preference to auto-add ":" in CSS Code Assist.
</li><li> Fixed the Preview button on the Mac.
</li><li> Fixed issues with Code Assist not showing on various DOM elements.
</li><li> Fixed various documentation typos and formatting errors.
</li></ul>
<a name="Known_Issues_5"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Known Issues</span></h3>
<ul><li> Aptana does not yet support unicode files.
</li><li> Performance can be slow on large (&gt; 3000 line) files.
</li><li> The Word Wrap feature was causing performance issues in CSS files and in large JavaScript files. This preference has been temporarily disabled until these issues can be resolved.
</li><li> Nested div tags in the HTML Editor do not correctly auto-close.
</li><li> If after updating and re-starting Aptana, you discover that you have lost your preference settings, your workspace may have been switched as part of the update. You can resolve this by switching your workspace back to your previous workspace. See <a href="Switching_your_workspace.html" title="Switching your workspace">Switching your workspace</a> for details.
</li></ul>
<p>These issues will all be fixed in an upcoming release.

<a name="Aptana_Beta_.31_update_.2822-July-2006.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aptana Beta .31 update (22-July-2006)</span></h2>
<p>The Aptana Beta .31 release (22-July-2006) improves on the Aptana Beta .30 Release with features such as an AJAX library wizard, Outline View enhancements, and numerous bug fixes. 
</p>
<a name="What.27s_New_8"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What's New</span></h3>
<p><b>AJAX Library Wizard</b>
</p><p>You can now quickly access Code Assist on your favorite AJAX JavaScript libraries by creating an AJAX library project. Currently, Aptana supports creating projects based on the AFLAX, Dojo, JQuery, MochiKit, Prototype, Rico, script.aculo.us, and Yahoo UI libraries. See <a href="Creating_a_new_AJAX_library_project.html" title="Creating a new AJAX library project">Creating a new AJAX library project</a> for more details.
</p><p><b>Outline View Enhancements</b>
</p><p>This release includes enhancements to the Outline View, such as support for the following items:

<a name="Aptana_Beta-.30_update_.2811-July-2006.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aptana Beta-.30 update (11-July-2006)</span></h2>
<p>The Aptana Beta .30 release (11-July-2006) improves on the Aptana Beta .25 Release with features such as browser support information and increased flexibility in integrating your code documentation into Code Assist. 
</p>
<a name="What.27s_New_9"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What's New</span></h3>
<p><b>Browser support added to Code Assist</b>
</p><p>Aptana's Code Assist now includes browser support information. Browser support currently includes CSS, HTML, JavaScript Core language, HTML DOM Level 0, and HTML DOM Level 1 &amp; 2 (partial). Browsers included in this feature are Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, and Netscape. Full support for the HTML DOM will be added in an upcoming release.
</p><p>By default, Code Assist displays browser icons for IE and Mozilla. To add icons for Opera, Safari, or Netscape, go to <b>Window &gt; Preferences...</b> On the left side of the window, expand <b>Aptana</b> and select <b>User Agents</b>. Check or uncheck the boxes next to the browsers that you want to display support for in Code Assist.
</p><p><b>Increased ScriptDoc flexibility</b>
</p><p>When you document a library for ScriptDoc to include in Code Assist, you now have the option of documenting your code either inline or in a corresponding ScriptDoc file (.sdoc). See <a href="Documenting_your_code_in_an_.sdoc_file.html" title="Documenting your code in an .sdoc file">Documenting your code in an .sdoc file</a> for details how to set up your library and .sdoc files.
</p><p><b>Aptana Perspectives merged</b>
</p><p>The Aptana Projects Perspective and Aptana Perspective have been merged. You can now switch effortlessly between the File View (any folders and files on your hard drive) and Project View (your Aptana "projects") in your workbench without having to change perspective.
</p><p><b>New Actions View</b>
</p><p>New in this release, the Actions View contains actions to help you automate common JavaScript development tasks. You can also create your own Actions View scripts to further customize the Aptana UI. See <a href="Displaying_the_Actions_View.html" title="Displaying the Actions View">Displaying the Actions View</a> for details.
</p><p><b>Improved Code Assist</b>
</p><p>Code Assist has been enhanced to intelligently guess which JavaScript keyword, object, or function you are typing. For example, if you type the letter "f", Code Assist now automatically pre-selects the word "function" from the Code Assist terms list. The list of Code Assist terms also no longer blocks your cursor when it pops up in the Editor.
</p><p><b>Additional Outline View support for all web file types</b>
</p><p>The Outline View now supports all HTML, CSS, XML files. Outline View support for JavaScript has been improved in this release.
</p><p><b>Aptana now "remembers" open files</b>
</p><p>If you opened a file using the File View and close the Aptana IDE without closing the file, Aptana will automatically open that file for you in the Editor the next time that you start the IDE.
</p>
<a name="Known_Issues_7"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Known Issues</span></h3>
<p><b>Code Assist parse delay</b>
</p><p>If you are coding in the Aptana JavaScript Editor and switch from the Editor View to another view and then switch back to the Editor View, you will need to wait a few seconds for the Code Assist Profile View to re-parse the current profile and refresh Code Assist before you will be able to access Code Assist again. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.
</p><p><b>MochiKit demos on mochikit.com use MochiKit v1.4</b>
</p><p>The MochiKit demos found at <a href="http://www.mochikit.com/demos.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mochikit.com/demos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mochikit.com/demos.html</a> use some functions from the upcoming MochiKit v1.4 release. At this time, Aptana only supports the current MochiKit v1.3.1 release. If you try to type in these demos from the MochiKit web site, some functions may be undocumented. However, all samples included in the official v1.3.1 download should work as expected.
</p><p><b>Parentheses matching not functional</b>
</p><p>The parentheses matching feature, which highlighted the parenthesis or brace that matched the parenethesis or brace that your cursor was on, is not functional in this release. This will be fixed in a coming release.
</p><p><b>Eclipse (v3.2) Plugin support does not include File View</b>
</p><p>If you decide to install Aptana as a plugin for Eclipse v3.2, the File View will not be functional.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<a name="Aptana_Beta_.25_update_.2814-June-2006.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aptana Beta .25 update (14-June-2006)</span></h2>
<p>The Aptana Beta .25 release (14-June-2006) improves on the Aptana Beta .20 Release with features such as MochiKit library support and enhanced colorization. 
</p><p>Starting with this release, the Aptana development team is focusing on implementing support for some of the most popular AJAX libraries used by the open source community. Because these libraries tend to use unique syntax and features, such as dynamic loading, each of the next few Aptana releases will focus on providing comprehensive support for approximately one new library or toolkit with each release. For this release, the Aptana team focused on the MochiKit library.
</p>
<a name="What.27s_New_10"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What's New</span></h3>
<p><b>Integrated Code Assist on MochiKit libraries</b>
</p><p>Aptana has made it easier for you to code projects that use the MochiKit libraries:
</p>
<ul><li> Aptana now includes a fully documented version of MochiKit (v1.3.1) that has been integrated into the Code Assist system. You can now access all of the parameters and return types for MochiKit functions and objects by simply pressing <b>ctrl+space</b> in an HTML file that uses a Code Assist profile containing the documented MochiKit libraries.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The <b>New MochiKit Library Project</b> wizard enables you to quickly create web projects that utilize the MochiKit libraries. The wizard not only creates your project for you, it also creates a Code Assist Profile view for you to easily use Code Assist to help you with MochiKit functions and objects.
</li></ul>
<p><b>Faster Colorization</b>
</p><p>The colorization feature in Aptana now runs much faster than in previous releases. Faster colorization leads to improved overall performance for your coding experience in our Editors.
</p><p><b>Code Assist Refinements</b>
</p><p>This release adds several refinements to the Code Assist feature. These refinements include displaying the source file for an object or function in the Code Assist menu and Code Assist now activating on a pause in typing in the JavaScript Editor.
</p><p><b>Additional platforms supported</b>
</p><p>The Beta .25 release contains support for several additional platforms:
</p>
<ul><li> On the Mac, both Power-PC and Intel-based Macs are supported. This release includes a universal binary version of Aptana that enables us to support both Mac platforms.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> On Windows-based machines, Aptana now supports Windows 2000. 
</li></ul>
<p><b>Memory Leak Issue Improved</b>
</p><p>All known memory leak issues that were causing Aptana to sometimes crash when saving a file have been resolved. We will continue testing to ensure that all of these issues have been fixed.

<ul><li> Aptana has not yet implemented full Dojo Toolkit support yet. Although this release adds support for MochiKit, support for Dojo will be added in an upcoming release. As part of our upcoming Dojo support, we will focus on enabling our JavaScript Editor to recognize some of the coding constructs unique to Dojo and will offer full Code Assist on this toolkit.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> In the Project View, if you rename a .js file that uses a Code Assist profile (e.g. a .js file created by the MochiKit project wizard) and add/update the link to the .js file in the current .htm file, you will need to open and close the .htm file to refresh the profile and to re-enable Code Assist.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Autocompletion in the JavaScript feature will be further refined in an upcoming release.

<a name="What.27s_New_11"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What's New</span></h3>
<p><b>Enhanced Code Assist Profiles View functionality</b>
</p><p>The Code Assist Profiles View makes it easier for you to manage the files that you use as sources for Code Assist:
</p>
<ul><li> You can now create profiles for your different projects/folders in the Code Assist Profiles View so that Code Assist displays appropriately for the file(s) that you are currently working on. For example, if you have two different JavaScript libraries with a function named "foo", you can create separate profiles for each library so that the appropriate Code Assist is invoked depending on what you are working on.
</li><li> You can drag-and-drop files within the Code Assist Profiles View to organize your files.
</li><li> The former "Libraries View" was renamed "Code Assist Profiles View" to better reflect its functionality. 
</li></ul>
<p><b>Improved context-sensitive (F1) help</b>
</p><p>This release contains significant additions to the Aptana context-sensitive (<b>F1</b>) help system. 
</p>

</li><li> HTML and CSS now have more robust documentation, including short code samples.
</li></ul>
<p>To access the new online help topics, either press <b>F1</b> while your cursor is on the word or element that you are searching for help on, or go through the online help system available from <b>Help &gt; Help Contents</b>.

</li><li> File now automatically refreshes when you save a file to an expanded folder.
</li></ul>
<p><b>New fixes</b>

<a name="What.27s_New_15"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">What's New</span></h3>
<p><b>New Aptana Web Perspective</b>
</p><p>This alpha release features a new Web Perspective that eliminates the need to create "projects" in order to work with your files. Highlights of the new perspective include the following features:
</p>
<ul><li> The new perspective has one new View and one upgraded View:
<ul><li> <b>File View</b> - Use the File View to access any files on your computer. If the file system seems out of date, click the <b>Refresh</b> button <a href="Image:IconRefresh.png.html" class="image" title="Image:iconRefresh.png"><img alt="Image:iconRefresh.png" src="docs/images/f/f7/IconRefresh.png" width="23" height="22" border="0" /></a> to refresh the view. To learn more, see <a href="Displaying_the_File_View.html" title="Displaying the File View">Displaying the File View</a>.
</li><li> <b>Code Assist Profiles View</b> - Use the Code Assist Profiles View to manage the libaries that you can use for Code Assist. To learn more, see <a href="Displaying_the_Code_Assist_Profiles_View.html" title="Displaying the Code Assist Profiles View">Displaying the Code Assist Profiles View</a>.
</li></ul>
</li><li> The Project View is no longer the most prominent default view on the left side of the screen. The left side of the screen now contains the File View and Code Assist Profiles View. (The old Project View is now directly behind the File View.) 
</li><li> By default, Aptana now provides Code Assist only for the JavaScript Core language and DOM. To access Code Assist for other libraries, add them to the Code Assist Profiles View by either dragging the library file into the View or by clicking the <b>Add File</b> button <a href="Image:IconAddFile.png.html" class="image" title="Image:iconAddFile.png"><img alt="Image:iconAddFile.png" src="docs/images/2/25/IconAddFile.png" width="23" height="22" border="0" /></a>.
</li></ul>
<p><b>New Problems View</b>
</p><p>The Problems View has been revamped and now displays HTML and JavaScript syntax errors. The new Problems View now only shows errors in the currently active Editors. (You can still access the old Eclipse Problems View by selecting <b>Show View &gt; Problems</b> from the <b>Window</b> menu.)
</p>
<a name="Known_Issues_11"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Known Issues</span></h3>
<p>The following list contains known issues associated with the 20-Mar-2006 Aptana Alpha release.
</p><p><b>Run web site preview feature</b>
</p>
<ul><li> The Web Site Preview feature, accessed by clicking the <b>Launch Start Page</b> button <a href="Image:IconLaunchStartPage.png.html" class="image" title="Image:iconLaunchStartPage.png"><img alt="Image:iconLaunchStartPage.png" src="docs/images/d/d0/IconLaunchStartPage.png" width="36" height="22" border="0" /></a>, currently only has limited functionality. This issue is temporary and will soon be fixed in an upcoming release.
</li><li> To preview a web site, you can still use either the Preview tab in the HTML Editor, or configure an external web server.
</li></ul>
<p><b>Online Help</b>

<p>The following list contains known issues associated with the 10-Mar-2006 Aptana Alpha release. 
</p><p><b>HTML and CSS Editors (Update: Fixed in Beta .1)</b>
</p>
<ul><li> Both the HTML Editor and CSS Editor contain only basic functionality and will be significantly upgraded in the next release. Although we welcome feature requests to help us prioritize what should be included the the new versions of these Editors, bug reporting should be focused on the JavaScript Editor.
<ul><li> The <a href="Using_Open_Declaration_to_jump_to_a_function_in_your_code.html" title="Using Open Declaration to jump to a function in your code"> Open Declaration</a> feature currently does not work in the HTML Editor.
</li><li> Code Assist is not functional in the CSS Editor.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Code Assist (Update: Fixed in Beta .1)</b>
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="About_Code_Assist.html" title="About Code Assist"> Code Assist</a> currently will not appear, other than for arguments, inside of the ()'s of a function call.
</li><li> In the alpha release, Code Assist works for static built-in objects (e.g. Math, Date, etc.), JavaScript primitives, new objects and primitives, and documented functions and property types.
</li></ul>
<p><b>Parsing Errors</b>
</p>
<ul><li> Some parser errors trigger automatic bug report submissions. 
<ul><li> How can you tell if an error automatically submitted a bug report? If the Aptana IDE automatically opened an Edit history.txt file, a bug report was also automatically submitted. This type of submission will only happen once per file.
</li><li> You will need to have the <b>-Dhistory=100</b> command line option turned on to enable automatic bug report submission.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Typing the string "0x" (zero-x) followed by a hexadecimal value may report a false error.
</li></ul>
