					<p>I am still new to eclipse/aptana, but have installed two versions of the IDE and aptana, and still, my File &gt;new &gt; Untitled HTML (or any other) will NOT open a new document to edit. I can only do it using the wizard.  Is this a bug?
</p><p>...
</p><p>To confirm, you're using the IDE, and not Eclipse 3.2? Eclipse 3.2 does have a known issue with the "Untitled HTML" wizards and we're working on that. One thought is that if you can submit your log file (via Help &gt; Submit Log File) that can help us see if there is an error causing the problem. Otherwise, it should work fine.
</p><p>...
</p><p>I am using 3.2. 
If I have  a project folder selected, it works. If not, it doesn't.  Where do I post the errors--and how?
</p><p>...
</p><p>If you want to be able to create a new HTML (or other) file without using the wizard, you'll need to be in File View instead of Project View. I'm betting that your issue stems from the fact that File View loses its functionality when you are using Aptana as a plugin for Eclipse 3.2. This is a known issue. See <a href="Release_Notes_Archive.html#Known_Issues_2" title="Release Notes Archive">Release Notes Archive#Known_Issues_2</a>. HTH.
